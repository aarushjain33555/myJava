Some of my java code assignment submitted as part of ICS3U7.

## BubbleSort
(aaray, for loop and while loop)

This program saved 1000 random numbers in an array and sort them in ascending order using Bubble Sort algorithm.

## HailstoneSequence
(do-while loop and if-else)

This program print Hailstone Sequene for an integer number entered.
If the number is even it is divided in halg and if it is odd, it is multilpied by 3 and then add 1. This is repeated until the number reaches 1.

e.g. for number 3 entered by user, it will print 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

## PrimeFactor
(for loop, while loop, if-else)

This program prints prime factor of any integer number entered by user, it will print following 2 lines -
  3 to the power of 2
  5 to the power of 1

e.g. for number 45 entered

## PrintBackwards
(while loop, if)

  3
  8
  4

## ScannerAJ
(use Scanner class)

This program prnts which digit is in one place or tens place or hunderds place for a 3 digit integer number entered by user.

    The hundreds-place digit is: 3
    The tens-place digit is: 4
    The ones-place digit is: 5

## SumOfCubeOfDigits
(while loop, it)

This program calculates the cube of each digit of 2 digit number and the prints ths sum.

e.g. for number 34 entered (3^3 + 4^3 = 27 + 64 = 91), it will print
  The sum of the cubes of the digit is 91

## TimeAndChange

This programs genertes a random number and then multiply and add some static number. It then calculates time in 24 hour format hr:mm:ss.
It also does some price calculations of a random number and then prints.

## password
(while loop, if-else)

This program tries to match an entered 4 digit integer number with 1234. It allows user to retry maximum 3 times.

## random
